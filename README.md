# About

Career.io is a web application for people looking for remote job offers in the IT industry and for employers offering such employment. It was created due to the growing interest in remote work on the market and the need to switch to this form of work in some cases due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The application offers the ability to search for job offers by, among others, the name of the position, type of contract and keywords. The job seeker can be sure that the potential future employer offers fully remote work, because only such offers appear on the platform. The job seeker also has the opportunity to learn more about the future employer, his work culture and the technologies used by the company using the "Employer profiles" subpage. The platform also offers the option of saving a job offer to favorites, viewing recently viewed job offers and removing a job offer from the recommended offers.
For employers, the application offers the possibility of setting up an account, creating an employer profile and adding a job offer.
